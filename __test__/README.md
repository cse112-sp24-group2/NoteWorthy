## Testing

List how to test our code (unit and E2E) and what we use to test.

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for our backend unit testing (tests located in [./jestTesting](./jestTesting/)).

Additionally, we use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) for end-to-end testing (tests located in [./puppeteerTesting](./puppeteerTesting/))

To run unit and end-to-end tests, run

```
npm run test
```
