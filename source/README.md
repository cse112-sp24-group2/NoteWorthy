# Instructions

We use Vite to bundle all of our files, therefore there are a couple of extra steps to run / build our project. 

To install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```
To work on the project and have to reloading when changes are made:
```
npm run dev
```
To view the final deploy version, you need to bundle/build all of the files, then you can preview them as such:
```
npm run build
```
```
npm run preview
```
