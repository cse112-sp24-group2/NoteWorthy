# Waiving 2 Approvals for PRs and Switching to Trunk-First Development

Date: June 3 2024

## Context
With the project deadline approaching, the 2-approval PR process is slowing development. To meet the deadline, we will waive this requirement and adopt trunk-first development.

## Decision
1. Waive the 2-approval requirement for PRs.
2. Implement trunk-first development (push directly to main).

### Consequences

Pros:
- Faster development.
- Reduced bottlenecks.

Cons:
- Higher risk of bugs.
- Potential decrease in code quality.

## Main Reason

Waiting for 2 approvals for pull requests is slow and we still need to accomplish quite a bit before the Sunday deadline.

# Approved
