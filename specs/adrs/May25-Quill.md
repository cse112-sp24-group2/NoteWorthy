## Context
In the development of our web application, which includes a feature-rich text editing environment, we require a text editor that allows users to easily create and format content. The editor must be robust, customizable, and capable of integrating seamlessly with the rest of the application's architecture. After evaluating various options, Quill Rich Text Editor has been identified as a potential candidate.

## Decision
We have decided to integrate the Quill Rich Text Editor into our web application. Quill will be used for creating and managing rich text content, providing users with capabilities such as text formatting, insertion of images, and complex document construction.

## Reason
- Allow for a better user experience when writing notes
More intuitive way to take notes
- Get rid of need to learn markdown language for styling
- Easier than writing our own rich text editor
- Gets rid of preview/edit mode switches
- Remove need for markdown conversion.
